## **Problem Statement**

 <br>
 
 <br>
 *Forest fires* are a major environmental issue, creating economical and ecological damage while endangering human lives. Fast detection is a key element for controlling such phenomenon. To achieve this, one alternative is to use automatic tools based on local sensors, such as provided by meteorological stations. In effect, meteorological conditions (e.g. temperature, wind) are known to influence forest fires and several fire indexes, such as the forest **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**, use such data.
 
 With the aid of technology and sensors, our aim to predict when these forest fires would occur, their intensity(extent of spread) and hopefully create a model based on the data    available in the forest Fire Weather Index(FWI) dataset.

 ## Objective
 
 
By undertaking this project, I intend to explore and experiment using a **Data Mining approach** to predict the burned area of forest fires.Different models such as  Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests would be trained with the given data, and the one with the highest accuracy(which is able to predict forest fires as precise as possible) would be selected. 

and four distinct feature selection setups (using spatial, temporal, FWI components and weather attributes), were tested on recent real-world data collected from the northeast region of Portugal. The best configuration uses a SVM and four meteorological inputs (i.e.
temperature, relative humidity, rain and wind) and it is capable of predicting the burned area of small fires, which are more frequent. Such knowledge is particularly useful for improving firefighting resource management (e.g. prioritizing targets for air tankers and ground.
